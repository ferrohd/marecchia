# Marecchia npm Workspace

This directory serves as the heart of our efforts to bring peer-to-peer (P2P) streaming capabilities to various video players.

## Available Packages üì¶

Below is a list of the current npm packages available within the Marecchia project, each tailored to a specific video player technology.

- **@marecchia/hlsjs**: Designed for [`HLS.js`](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js), this package integrates P2P streaming to HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) content, optimizing video delivery while ensuring seamless playback.

_Aside from the listed package, the Marecchia team is continuously working on expanding support to other popular video players. Stay tuned for more updates._
